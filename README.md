Unlike linear search where we check every number in the array, binary search minimises the number of elements we have to iterate over by continually halving the dataset and only looking for the target in either of the two halves. To achieve this, binary search comes with a necessary prerequisite. The dataset must be first sorted in ascending or descending order before searching. In practice, this means that if we are trying to find the number 8 in an array, we can test a specific number from the dataset and ask whether that number is less than or greater than 8. Since we sorted the numbers in the array, we can assess whether the number we are looking for comes before or after the number we have just checked... c
